# Repository use
Created for use in analyzing PEP [poly(ethylene-co-propylene)] GPC data from Scott UCSB lab

## Inputs
1. .arw GPC output file name
2. Recovered mass (user input)

## Outputs
.xlsx file with time, refractive index, normalized refractive index, log(M), mass %, M (PS), M (PEP), number of carbons, mass of chains, moles of chains, and moles of C-C bonds

## How to use
make sure python file is in the same directory as GPC .arw data. run python script and answer user inputs. .xlsx will be generated in same directory.

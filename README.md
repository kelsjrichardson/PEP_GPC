# Repository use
Created for use in analyzing PEP [poly(ethylene-co-propylene)] GPC data from Segalman UCSB lab (PS standard, THF solvent)

## Inputs
1. .arw GPC output file name
2. Recovered mass (user input)

## Outputs
.xlsx file with time, refractive index, normalized refractive index, log(M), mass %, M (PS), M (PEP), number of carbons, mass of chains, moles of chains, and moles of C-C bonds

## How to use
Make sure the Python file is in the same directory as the GPC .arw data. Run Python script and answer user inputs. .xlsx will be generated in the same directory.
